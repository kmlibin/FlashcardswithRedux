# Flashcard App
## Codecademy Redux Toolkit Project

This is a simple app that allows you to create topics, then create quizzes based on those topics. You can create flashcards within those quizzes, each displaying information in the format of question (on front) and answer (on back). 

### Languages / Tools

React, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, CSS modules, HTML, JSX

### Project Highlights

The goal of this project was to practice and implement Redux Toolkit, as well as implementing a basic Thunk that allowed for two actions to be dispatched as part of a single process. Part of the app was already created, and my job was to create all of the slices of state, link them to the components, and then write the logic needed to update that state from the components. 

### What I learned / Challenges

This is really my first project with Redux Toolkit, and I did like that it certainly provided a more simplified process than standard Redux. The project definitely allowed me to see the process of linking things together - creating selectors, using selectors, and then dispatching actions in a component was something I needed more understanding of before this project. It was a bit confusing for me that the state consisted of objects within objects - that was something I had to consistently check myself on. The naming structure of the file also caught me off-guard at times, so I had to triple-check that I was in the correct file. 

I have often struggled with this type of project where Codecademy gives you half the code and expects you to somehow both create your own solution, but also incorporate certain names and functions they already declare. When learning new concepts and code, I've had a hard time with this because I'm not always sure what their code does, nor am I sure what I can and cannot keep. This time, I just went through and constantly console logged values, then just played around with changing names of their variables and functions. This did help me to see how they wanted the code put together, and it made it a bit easier to get the desired outcome.
